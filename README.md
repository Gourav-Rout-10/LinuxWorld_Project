### AWS Cloud-Based Python Project


This repository contains a comprehensive, menu-driven Python project that demonstrates the integration of various AWS services. The project is designed to automate cloud-based tasks using the boto3 library, providing an interactive interface to launch instances, manage cloud logs, upload files, and more. It also showcases event-driven architecture and MongoDB integration with AWS Lambda.

Features:-
1. Launch EC2 Instances
Automatically launch EC2 instances with specified configurations, allowing you to quickly deploy compute resources in the cloud.
2. RHEL GUI Instance in Cloud
Launch a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) instance with GUI support for more advanced use cases that require a graphical interface.
3. Access Logs from AWS CloudWatch
Retrieve and display logs from AWS CloudWatch Logs, enabling easy access to log data for debugging and monitoring purposes.
4. Event-Driven Architecture with AWS Transcribe
Automatically convert audio files uploaded to S3 into text using AWS Transcribe, showcasing an event-driven architecture.
5. Connect Python to AWS MongoDB Service via Lambda
Seamlessly connect Python to MongoDB service hosted on AWS using Lambda functions. This integration allows for efficient data management within the cloud ecosystem.
6. Upload Objects to S3
Upload any file to an S3 bucket, with support for specifying the file path and bucket name, making it easy to manage storage in the cloud.
7. Integrate Lambda with S3 and SES
Create an event-driven Lambda function that reads email IDs from a file stored in S3 and sends customized emails using AWS SES. This feature demonstrates how to leverage multiple AWS services together.

Prerequisites:-
Python 3.7+,
AWS CLI configured with your credentials,
Boto3 library (pip install boto3),
MongoDB URI (if using MongoDB integration)
